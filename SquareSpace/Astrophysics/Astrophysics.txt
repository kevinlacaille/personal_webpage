Distant galaxies

I am an observational astronomer working in the field of galaxy evolution and dynamics. I use the world's best telescopes to look deep into space, and back in time, to a time when galaxies were younger and and more violent than they are today.

I look for galaxies that emit the majority of their light as radio waves, as they represent some of the rarest and most extreme galaxies in the Universe. I study the gas that fuels their star formation and the dust heated by exploding stars and active black holes.

Protostars

In addition to the ultra-distant galaxies, I also peer into nearby dusty regions of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, in search for infant stars called protostars, the building blocks of stars like our Sun.

Protostars are fascinating celestial objects which start off as a cold gaseous cloud, evolving into a turbulent and explosive system with high-energy jets that would destroy the Earth, if placed in its direction.




Observing

I have spent over 450 hours observing distant stars and galaxies on some of the worldâ€™s most powerful telescopes in Hawaii at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and the Sub-Millimeter Array.

In addition, I have been awarded nearly 400 hours of observing time: 4 hrs Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, 31 hrs Canada France Hawaii Telescope, 25 hrs Gemini Observatory, 15 hrs NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array, 300 James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, 12 hrs Sub-Millimetre Array.





Instrumentation

In addition to observing, I worked on commissioning the polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, POL-2.

POL-2 allows the telescope to indirectly observe magnetic fields within our own galaxy, allowing us uncover new physics on the process of star formation.
