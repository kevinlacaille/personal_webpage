A scientist, a cyclist, an aerospace enthusiast, and a proud dad!

This is Luna.

Sheâ€™s a good girl.

This is Ellie.

Sheâ€™s also a good girl.

And together, they have lots of fun.

This is my bike.

She gets me where I need to be, quickly! In the summers youâ€™ll see me riding it with my friends at Freewheel Cycle or occasionally racing with MEC.

And whenever we can, my wife and I love to explore the world!
