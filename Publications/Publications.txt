Two sub-millimetre bright protoclusters bounding the epoch of peak star formation activity

We discovered two primordial galaxy clusters that contained groups of a rare type of galaxy. These galaxy clusters are forming stars 10,000x more rapidly than the average galaxy cluster, making them extraordinary celestial objects.

Galaxy growth in a massive halo in the first billion years of cosmic history

We uncovered a pair of extremely massive star-forming galaxies existing when the Universe was only 5% of its current age. The larger galaxy is one of the rarest galaxies that should exist in the Universe at this epoch.

A massive core for a cluster of galaxies at a redshift of 4.3

We found a single primordial galaxy cluster comprised of 14 explosive galaxies. This extragalactic object is a uniquely massive and dense system that could be building one of the most massive structures in the Universe today.

The JCMT Transient Survey: Data Reduction and Calibration Methods

We calibrated star maps in order to precisely measure tiny changes in a protostar’s brightness. Upon comparing just a few maps, my code was able to align the maps to an error smaller than 100th the size of a single pixel, resulting in unprecedented measures of protostars.
